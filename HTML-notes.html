Whitespace is irrelevant, spaces are irrelevant.

<h1> header level 1 </h1>
<h2> header level 2 </h2>
<p> paragraph text</p>
<strong> for "strong" bold text </strong>
<em> for "emphasis" italics</em> 

combine the above by combining tags:

<h1><em>italicized header</em></h1>

"Anchor" A Attributes:

1. HTML with text.  The inner HTML is the text of the link.
<a href="https://google.com/">Text of the link </a>

2. Attribute only, no HTML, image
<img src="bacon.jpg">

    You can add an image from harddrive- right click in explorer and Upload > select image.

3. Nested HTML with link to image. Can also use a regular URL.
<a href="https://google.com/"><img src="google.png"></a>

Bullets must be nested.
<ul>
    <li>list item one</li>
    <li>list item two</li>
    <li>list item three</li>
</ul>

Create new pages by "NEW FILE" in the explorer. Name them something, then you can link to them.
<p><a href="page2.html">Go to the second page</a></p>

To create it a valid HTML document, you need:
1. Doctype
2. <html> element</html>
    3. <head>element</head>
    4. <body>element</body>

   !! To do this as a shortcut, just go to top of page and do exclaimation mark ! and tab. 

HTML is only for the structure of the document and content, NOT the look and feel.
If you want look and feel, you will need CSS.

HTML <form> element </form> is like a link but with more data. 
    Need a page to collect the form data 
    And another page to accept the form data
